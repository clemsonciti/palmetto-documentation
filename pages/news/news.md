The `/scratch4` folder has been re-initialized and all the files on it have been deleted. This action was necessary because the disk had hardware issues. Palmetto users were notified two weeks prior and a day prior. The process started at 3pm and was finished at 11pm. The disk is back online and operating as usual.
