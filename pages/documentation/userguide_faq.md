## Who can use Palmetto?

Palmetto cluster is available at no charge to all Clemson University
students, faculty and staff.

Palmetto [Condo owners]({{site.baseurl}}/userguide_palmetto_overview.html#condominium-model)
may also request access to collaborators unaffiliated with Clemson University.
This request must be made by the owner (not the external collaborator)
to <ithelp@clemson.edu>.
If access is granted, such "visitor" accounts on Palmetto may only submit jobs
to the associated owner queue.

## What do I need to know to use the cluster?

Users primarily interact with the cluster via the [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).
Thus, some knowledge of the Linux command-line is essential.
The [CITI](https://citi.sites.clemson.edu/) group offers workshops
each month on Linux and Palmetto; the training schedule can be found [here](https://citi.sites.clemson.edu/training/).

## Why can't I log-in?

1. Perhaps your password was entered incorrectly. Try logging in to other Clemson services such as iRoar.
1. Perhaps your password was entered incorrectly **three times**. This "bans" you from logging-in
for 15 minutes. Wait a while and try again.
1. Perhaps you are not enrolled for 2FA. Visit <http://2fa.app.clemson.edu/>.
1. Something else is wrong.

If you need to change your password, please go to [Clemson Password Change Service](https://idp.clemson.edu/password/change.php) or contact the CCIT Help Desk.
The Palmetto team cannot help with changing your password.
