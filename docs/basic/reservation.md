# Special Reservation

You can submit a request to allocate a special computational queue for you. This queue is granted for a short time (one or two months, usually), and during this time it works like an [owner's queue](https://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/palmetto/owner/). This request is granted in special circumstances, e.g. you are close to graduation or you have a very important deadline to meet. 

To submit a request, please email ithelp@clemson.edu with the subject "Palmetto Reservation". Inside the email, please answer the following questions:

- Name
- Clemson Username
- Faculty Advisor's Clemson Username
- Research Abstract: very important! Please provide a description of your research and how Palmetto will help with your research goals.
- Reason for Reservation: please explain why your research requires a dedicated reservation (mention deadlines and any other special circumstances).
- Specific Hardware Requirements (for example, "Any GPU nodes", "Only P100 nodes", "HDR Interconnect" etc.)
- Node count: Number of requested nodes
- Palmetto phase (if applicable; you can run `cat /etc/hardware-table` on Palmetto login node to see the hardware specs for different phases)
- Required long-term storage (TB) (if any)
- Number of jobs that will be run simultaneously
- Maximum walltime (hours)
- Preferred start date
- Duration (days)

After we receive your application, we will have a meeting with you where we go over it to see if we can satisfy your needs with the usual PAlmetto procedures. If you do need a special reservation, we will submit a request to [CU-CAT (Clemson University Computational Advisory Team)](https://ccit.clemson.edu/about/governance/clemson-university-computational-advisory-team/) for evaluation. You will receive information about their decision within a few days.
