# Research Support (during Covid-19 operation period)

### Office Hours (in-person support) 

In response to recent events and effective Monday, March 16, the CITI ACDS team 
is now delivering Palmetto office-hours, consultations, and training **online via 
web-conferencing**. In particular, the weekly Wednesday office-hours and Friday 
on-boarding will be hosted online via Zoom. Furthermore, all training will also 
be delivered online through Zoom. These changes will remain in place until the university provides further direction. Please follow our guidelines outlined below:

1. Sign-in to <https://clemson.zoom.us> and use your Clemson username and password to 
activate your account. This only needs to be done   once to activate your Zoom account. You 
will receive an email from Zoom that confirms your registration and contains the activation 
link. If you do not receive an email within an hour, please notify <ithelp@clemson.edu>.

2. Once you have access to Zoom, please use the following link to go to our Zoom channel and register for the date/time that works for you:

produce the problem
