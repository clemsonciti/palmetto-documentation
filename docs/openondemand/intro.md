# Introduction to Open OnDemand

[Open OnDemand (OOD)](https://openondemand.org/) is a browser-based GUI for interacting with 
supercomputers. Developed and maintained by the Ohio Supercomputing Center, OOD provides users
with a unified and easy-to-use interface to help streamline most frequent interactions with 
the backend large-scale computing resources. 

The OOD interface at Clemson University has first been deployed in June 2021. While we are 
making this interface available to Palmetto user community, it is still under active development 
and customization. There could still be minor changes made to the interface, and new tools and 
capabilities will be added. We look forward to comment and feedback from our users to further 
improve our OOD deployment. 

## Access the OOD interface. 

At the moment, the OOD interface requires users to be either on-campus or on Clemson VPN in order 
to access the page. Instructions on how to be on Clemson VPN from off campus [can be found here](https://ccit.clemson.edu/services/network-phones-cable/network/vpn/).

The OOD site is located at [https://openod02.palmetto.clemson.edu](https://openod02.palmetto.clemson.edu). You will need to authenticate using both DUO and your Clemson password.

The OOD dashboard contains all OOD utilities to access Palmetto:

- **Files**: Links to `/home`, `/scratch1`, and `/scratch2` directories. The 
destination link will provide users with the ability to browser, upload, download, 
view, create, edit, and delete their files and folders. 
- **Jobs**: Allow users to create, submit, and monitor batch jobs on Palmetto. 
- **Clusters**: Provide users with a browser-based shell environment
- **Interactive Apps**: Provide users with browser-based GUI applications. This includes 
applications that typically require VNC (Matlab, Abaqus, COMSOL ...) or are served via 
a web server (Jupyter, RStudio, Tensorboard ...)
- **Develop**: This utility is only granted on a case-by-case basis. This allows advanced 
users to develop their own interactive apps on Palmetto. 
- **Help**: Link to documentation and utility to restart users' dashboard server (for app 
development purposes).
