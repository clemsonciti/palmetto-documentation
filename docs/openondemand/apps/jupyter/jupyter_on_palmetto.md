### Jupyter Lab on the Palmetto Cluster

OpenOD allows users to interact with the Palmetto cluster
from their web browsers using the [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyter.org/) interface,
and to prototype and develop code in **Python**, **R**, **MATLAB** and several other languages.

6. Once you launch your server you will be taken to your [current list of interactive sessions](https://openod02.palmetto.clemson.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions "current list of interactive sessions"). Your job will be queued until resources are available to handle your request. Once that has happened you will be able to connect to your Jupyter server with a button.
