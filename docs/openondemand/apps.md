# Interactive Apps

Click on OOD Dashboard's **Interactive Apps** dropdown menu will display a number of 
browser-based GUI and server-dependent apps. This is an alternative to the traditional X11 GUI 
forwarding via external terminal. 

*At this moment, the Desktop app is not yet setup, and a number of GUI-based apps (ANSYS, MatLab, and COMSOL).

- `Abaqus/CAE`
- `VSCode Server`
- `Jupyter and Spark`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
- `Jupyter for Tensorflow`
- `RStudio Server`
- `TensorBoard`

The interactive apps will have an form for users to specify resource requirement in a manner 
similar to the well known JupyerHub interface for Palmett (*JupyterHub will eventually be 
retired). In the remainder of this section, a brief introduction to each interactive app will 
be provided, and any special consideration, if necessary, will be provided.
