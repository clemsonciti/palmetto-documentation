- User can view a file by click **View** or edit a file using **Edit**. They can also 
create a **New File** or a **New Directory**, **Upload** or **Download** files, and 
**Rename** or **Move** a file. 

- Clicking **Edit** or **New File** will end up with another new browser tab that is a 
browser-based editor for OOD. 

- The browser-based editor will have options for users to change themes, font, and 
highlighting schemes depending on the programming languages they are working on.

- The **Save** button on the top-left of the tab is initially gray (see the previous), but once a change is made to the document, it will become highlighted and clickable. 
- **You must manually click this button periodically to ensure that your data is saved. At the moment, there is no Auto-Save feature for this editor.**
