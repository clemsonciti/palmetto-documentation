## Fall 2022 Training Schedule

*Starting Spring 2021, we will also test our recorded workshop features, 
where Zoom-based workshops are recorded and sent by request **to workshop attendees only**. All recordings will 
require Clemson's authentication to view. Downloading is not permitted. Please contact ithelp@clemson.edu for the link* 

Please click on Registration for each of the workshop below. The Registration link will be accessible 1 week prior to the workshop. You will need to use g.clemson.edu to access the registration form.

Once done, our workshop facilitator will send the zoom link to your registered email few days before the workshop date.
