## Spring 2023 Training Schedule

*Starting Spring 2021, we will also test our recorded workshop features, 
where Zoom-based workshops are recorded and sent by request **to workshop attendees only**. All recordings will 
require Clemson's authentication to view. Downloading is not permitted. Please contact ithelp@clemson.edu for the link* 

Please click on Registration for each of the workshop below. The Registration link will be accessible 1 week prior to the workshop. **You will need to use g.clemson.edu to access the registration form.**

Once done, our workshop facilitator will send the zoom link to your registered email few days before the workshop date.
