## Fall 2021 Training Schedule

*Starting Spring 2021, we will also test our recorded workshop features, 
where Zoom-based workshops are recorded and sent by request. All recordings will 
require Clemson's authentication to view. Downloading is not permitted. Please contact ithelp@clemson.edu for the link*
