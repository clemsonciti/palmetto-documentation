# Spack: software package manager

Starting August 2020, Palmetto utilizes [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) to 
manage the installation and configuration of its research software packages. As a package 
management tool developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL), Spack allows both 
system administrators and users to manage the installation and configuration of many research
software packages and their dependencies in a streamlined and transparent manner.

Palmetto users can also use Spack to manage their own software libraries (software packages 
that are not part of Palmetto's modules). While it is possible to download and utilize one's 
own Spack libraries, users can also leverage Palmetto's existing Spack installation by 
running the following:

```
$ source /software/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```
